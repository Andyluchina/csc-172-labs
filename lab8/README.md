# Lab 8

<!-- You can see this README rendered _much_ nicer online: https://github.com/strugee/csc-172-labs/blob/master/lab8/README.md -->

This project contains an implementation of lab 8.

## Running

I've copied the `BTNode` class into the Lab8P1 and Lab8P2 classes since the lab specification didn't say how these should/would be provided and I had to provide it _somehow_ in order to make the code compile.

If you want to bring your own `BTNode` class, feel free - it hasn't been modified:

1. Delete the `BTNode` classes from the relevant files
2. Create a `BTNode.java` and ensure its compiled version is on the classpath
3. Add `import BTNode;` statements to the files you removed the `BTNode` classes from

## Design

The inline comments should be enough to give you an idea of how stuff works; it's all pretty standard.
