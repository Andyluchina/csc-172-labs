# Lab 5

<!-- You can see this README rendered _much_ nicer online: https://github.com/strugee/csc-172-labs/blob/master/lab5/README.md -->

This project contains an implementation of lab 5.

## Running

`URList.java` and `URNode.java` are expected to be on the classpath.

## Assumptions made

All assumptions made are documented inline. You can grep for `Assumption:` to find them all, as they're all prefixed this way.

## Bugs

* The implementation is not thread-safe
* The `Iterable`s don't do `remove()`

## Git
