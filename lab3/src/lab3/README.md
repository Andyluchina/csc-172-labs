# Lab 3

This project contains tasks 1, 2, and 3 for CSC 172 lab 3, which is about nested array manipulation and display in preparation for the 2048 project.

Everything here is pretty standard except for the fact that tasks 1 and 2 share some code, which is shared in the `Lab3Util` module in `Lab3Util.java`. This module is imported through the usual Java way in both these tasks.

In order to modify the data in the array, or the mode of operation (for task 2), you are expected to modify the source code.
