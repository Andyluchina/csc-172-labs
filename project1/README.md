# 2048 game

This project contains an implementation of project 1, the 2048 game.

## Running

Run `main.java`.

## Features

* Interactive console display with [wasd] control keys
* Fancy Unicode game board output
* Supports quitting and restarting with `q` and `r` keys, respectively (with prompts, unless the game has been won or lost)
* Last key pressed and move validity information display
* Move count display
* Maximum number on board display
* Extensively commented
* Robust design (see the "Design" section)

## Bugs

* The design is not documented
* The algorithm to place a random number is horribly inefficient
* Unit tests are missing
* The model layer could use a lot of refactoring
